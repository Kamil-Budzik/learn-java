# Java Learning Progress
https://dev.java/learn/
I am simply exploring the Java learning path provided by Oracle. I will be checking off the topics as I go through them.

## Motivation
I want to learn fundaments of OOP languages and to be able to work with this tech in my daily job.<br>
I recently transitioned to a fullstack role in my daily job. We use both TS and Java. I am comfortable with TS but not with Java. I want to change that. 
After exploring the syntax I will probably build some simple games, and then build some more complex backend application with SpringBoot.

## Getting Started with Java
- [x] Downloading and setting up the JDK, writing your first Java class, and creating your first Java application.
- [x] Launching Single-File Source-Code Programs: Launching Single-File Source-Code Java programs with the Java launcher.
- [x] JShell - The Java Shell Tool: Interactively evaluate declarations, statements, and expressions of Java in a REPL.
- [x] Building a Java application in IntelliJ IDEA: Code, run, test, debug, and document a Java application in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Getting to Know the Language

- [ ] Regular Expressions: Overview of regex and core API classes.
- [ ] Introduction to Java Reflection: Discover fields, methods, and constructors with reflection.
- [ ] The Reflection API: Examine or modify runtime behavior.
- [ ] Introduction to Method Handles: Understand method handles and their tooling.
- [ ] Fundamentals of Security using JDK Libraries: Learn security APIs and core components.
- [ ] Virtual Threads: Understand what, why, and how of virtual threads.
- [ ] The Foreign Function and Memory API: Interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime.

## Organizing your Application
- [ ] Modules: Learn how the module system makes your code more maintainable.
- [ ] Creating Runtime and Application Images with JLink: Create custom runtime images or self-contained application images.

## Getting to Know the JVM
